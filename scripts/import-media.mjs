/**
 * Phase B — bring the real photographs in over the placeholders.
 *
 *   node scripts/import-media.mjs "C:/path/to/the/folder"
 *
 * The photographs arrive as large PNGs at whatever size the image model chose.
 * The site needs JPEGs at exact pixel sizes, small enough that a route carrying
 * nine of them stays inside its image budget. This script does that conversion
 * and nothing else: it never crops, never changes an aspect ratio, and never
 * renames a file. `room-01.png` becomes `room-01.jpg` and lands at the path the
 * content already points at.
 *
 * ── WHY IT LOOKS LIKE THIS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Node has no image codec and this project has exactly three runtime
 * dependencies, so there is nothing here to decode a PNG or write a JPEG. The
 * work happens on a canvas inside the Chromium that Playwright already installs
 * for the smoke suite — same trick as `generate-media.mjs`, same reason.
 *
 * Quality is not fixed. Each file is encoded at descending quality until it
 * fits the byte budget, and the quality it settled on is printed. A frame full
 * of fine grain needs a lower number than a frame that is mostly shadow, and
 * guessing one quality for all twenty-three either bloats the light frames or
 * ruins the busy ones.
 *
 * ── THE SIZE MISMATCH IS HANDLED, THE RATIO MISMATCH IS REFUSED ────────────
 *
 * A file at the right ratio but the wrong size is rescaled, which is lossless
 * in the ways that matter here. A file at the WRONG RATIO is refused rather
 * than squashed or silently cropped, because either choice changes the framing
 * the photograph was composed at and neither is mine to make.
